# Initial commit, 7/22/2025:

- Sends the ["pokemon.com"](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex) image for a random PokÃ©mon when prompted with `/poke`
- Responds with one of the Magic Conch quotes from Spongebob when prompted with `/conch`
- Whenever username "tuftydragon943" sends a message, immediately reacts with `ðŸ‘Ž`

# Commit 2, 7/23/2025:

- Mentioning the bot will now have it decypher the message, using the first letter of each word as a hint to a 6-digit alphabetic code which it will print
- Mentioning the bot with an invalid code will have it react with `ðŸ¥€`
- Added *`"No!"`* to `/conch` as a possible response and replaced `"Maybe"` with the lore-accurate `"Maybe, someday."`
- Ordered `/conch` responses based on the order they appear first in the episode
- Removed the bot-check guard from the bot's message response as it only ever replies to one human
- Replaced `if let Err(_) = ...` errors with `let _ = ...` with `map_err` to print the error instead for cleanliness
- Replaced `main` errors with `?` handling

# Commit 3, 7/26/2025:

- Added error logging for `Bot::message`
- Added more reactions for "tuftydragon943"
- Now tells people off for pinging everyone
- `/conch` responses are now stored in `&str`s not lazy `String`s
- Added `util.rs` with the `log_err` and `log_cmd` macros
- Simplified error logging with `log_err` which wraps `if let Err(e) = ...` cleanly
- Now logs every action performed or attemped with `log_cmd` which prints to the console with time, action, and cause
